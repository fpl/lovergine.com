summary: About toxicity of big-co socials and fediverse.
---

In a [previous post](https://lovergine.com/socials-they-are-not-your-home.html), 
I suggested that people should escape from big company-based
social networks and find refuge in the Fediverse. The reason for that is simply
to avoid being constantly considered a profitable customer, being profiled, and
continuously bombed from advertising campaigns or sponsored posts. In brief, the
purpose is returning to the original spirit of the big network of peers of the
90s.

Reading here and there on the Fediverse, I see that many people abandoned the
well-known prime-time socials because of the diffused toxicity of such
environments, censorship, and other bad personal experiences in their use.
Unfortunately, the past examples of newsgroups and IRC channels showed that even
Mastodon profiles or Matrix stanzas are not an answer for such drifts of digital
life. The new fediverse simply changed the user experience of communication
services, not the core social experience of them.

Nothing is truly different between modern Fediverse services and groups,
channels, or mailing lists of the old good days. Like it or not, we had trolls,
spammers, and other strange beasts even in the 90s - when the men were men, to
use an abused clause. Of course, the smaller the communities, the fewer the
social problems of interaction among individuals in the digital world, and
that's a fact of life. Therefore, a microblogging platform such as Mastodon
could seem a great place to live digitally happy. IMHO, it is only a matter of
time and critical mass (number of active accounts) before experiencing the same
type of dynamics, unfortunately.

Of course, we had solutions to mitigate the problems that have been always the
same in the last 30 years or more: 

 * Defining netiquette and conduct codes.
 * Introducing community-driven pools of moderators with privileges to kick off
pernicious individuals based on their behaviors and repeated violations of the
conduct codes. 
 * Never feeding the trolls.
 * Having a reasonable number of good bots to manage spammers and other harmful agents automatically.

Note that anonymity has never been a problem, so identifying users is not a solution and
should not be considered in the equation. It does not work as a definitive
deterrent, and those proposing such a practice are probably in bad faith.

That said, there is also a profound difference between a self-governed community
with a set of rules chosen and defined by the community itself and censorship
imposed by a company, a government, or any other external entities. This would
be an excellent opportunity for the Fediverse to conjugate a non-toxic
environment for users with a sane distributed network far from profit-only
logic. It only needs to be caught by Fediverse communities.

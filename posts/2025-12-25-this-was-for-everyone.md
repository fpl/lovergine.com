summary: A review of TimBL book 'This is for everyone'
---

I just finished reading the delightful book by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, titled _This
is for Everyone_, published this year. It is a trip, long, almost 400 pages,
about the origin and evolution of the World Wide Web, seen by those who
conceived and pushed it from the start. The entire first part of the book is
dedicated to the history of the web, the W3C, and the Web Foundation's
operations as we have known them in the first 30 years of its development, from
1989 onwards.

I was there at the very beginning of the 90s: I was connected to the Internet
since 1991, and reading such a book for a good part has been an emotional trip
in my memory of those events and people. He is a visionary and an idealist who
fought for an extended period to prevent his WWW creature from being intercepted
and disrupted by for-profit interests. 

It happened almost from the start, when first NCSA, then Netscape, and Microsoft
tried one after the other to change the whole idea of openness into something
proprietary, driven through the same scheme of embracing, extending, and
extinguishing. In practice, the complete negation of standard and openness, with
a clear goal in mind: obtaining users' lock-in into proprietary products,
clearly for profit.

Tim provides evidence on multiple critical aspects of the current incarnation of
the net as we know it today and over the last 20 years or more. They are both
technical and social defects or drifts. The web is no longer what we learnt to
know in its first years of existence. The start of the end of the original
web concept was the mobile-first approach, which relegated the use of a regular
computer to a second-class experience for most users. Most of the digital-native
people never used a computer to access the network, and that user experience
deeply affects the current vision of the web. 

For years, nowadays, a browser has not been the main program for accessing
content and services. Social networks are mostly not interoperable because
companies have little interest in having their users leave the walled gardens of
their apps. Using a browser and potentially exiting the company's services to
access other servers and spaces is tolerated, but is perceived as damaging
profits. That's simply because users are not users, but customers. The result is
[the shattered Internet about which I already wrote](https://lovergine.com/the-shattered-internet.html): the W3C standards are still
relevant, but embedded in applications and frameworks that enrich and upset the user
experience with proprietary workflows and extensions. 

An emblematic case is Apple, which has, in practice, abandoned its WebKit engine
and Safari browser in favor of apps and proprietary services to monetize
customers and companies. 

The concrete risk is that the whole web and its standards would become a
marginalized component of the net, while most users are confined to walled-off
realms of proprietary services and social networks. The recent AI innovation can
mark the definitive end chapter of web content creation and search as we have
used them over the last 30 years. More and more users will limit themselves to
AI-provided overviews instead of collecting and consulting multiple sources of
information and independent services. That will also have a concrete impact on
revenues and interest in content creation and provision at large. 

The second part of the book is fully dedicated to all such problems: the impact
of social networks, the last few years of generative AI, the BigCo dominance,
and includes all Tim's worries for the foreseeable future.  He's an idealistic,
optimistic, and positive guy due to his past experiences.  However, he also has
a good dose of sane realism. He understands that the path is nebulous and full
of dangers (specifically, the AI path is highly polarizing and can hide multiple
issues at many levels).

He sees in the indie web, and specifically in open and well-structured
distributed standards (such as the ActivityPub protocol), a possible way to
change the present and future by favoring interoperability and independence. A
concrete proposal is the Solid standard for personal data wallets (or pods in
Solid terminology) under complete user control for accessibility by third-party
services. Such a standard is still in its infancy, but the true problem I see is
the trustworthiness of involved parties, both companies and governments.
Trusting is the key, and maybe we all individually lost such a superpower a long time ago.

Creating a corpus of rules to manage all such technologies and ensure ethical
behavior can be a desperate illusion; the only concrete alternative would be to
opt out, at the cost of exclusion from the social context (not only the digital
one). But I agree there is no other way to recover the original idea of the web.
The AI technologies are even more polarizing, among doomers and boomers, with a
bumpy road ahead. For sure, open protocols and distributed multi-peer services
are the inevitable starting point, but they won't be enough.

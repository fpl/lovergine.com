summary: The problem with the Internet as it has become
---

I recently finished reading [a book published one year
ago](https://www.bollatiboringhieri.it/libri/vittorio-bertola-internet-fatta-a-pezzi-9788833942018/),
written by [Vittorio Bertola](https://bertola.eu/) and [Stefano Quintarelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Quintarelli). 
Unfortunately, it is only available in Italian, but its title perfectly encloses all the topics
it covers: _The shattered Internet: digital sovereignty, nationalisms, and big
techs_.  Like me, Vittorio and Stefano are among the relatively few early users and
participants of the primeval internet network of the 90s, even before the World
Wide Web was conceived. This book is a disenchanted and realistic travel in the
story of the _Big Network_ and how it has become a broken dream today in many
respects.

Thinking about it, it also shares some of the reasons why I started this
self-hosted blog recently. At the end of this post, one could also consider
that this site and the whole _indie web_ movement make little sense altogether.
Simply, they represent another unrealistic attempt to return to the origin.
In short, it's just a daydream. Maybe, or maybe not.

The Internet has been conceived from the beginning as a great, unified,
worldwide and resilient web of neutral connections based on open technical
standards and cooperation among developers and participants to allow
end-to-end communications all over the world, without discrimination.  At its very
beginning, in the middle of the 90s, it appeared to be a realized dream to the
most tech-savvy people. 

Unfortunately, reality later started to appear in all
its hard truth.  The world is not neutral and equal for all human beings, and
there are multiple drivers of inequality and diversity. Moreover, human groups
tend to create private _walled gardens_ with deep moats among themselves, often
for the mere interests of the few.

Nowadays, there are at least two great sources of fragmentation for the
Internet, because of its own worldwide success. Nationalisms (and let me also say
different ways of seeing life, values, and our society itself) and the creation
of an oligopoly of a few big companies that dominate the network. Companies are
interested in making a profit and maintaining their walled gardens with millions
of users-customers locked in there.
This is not something new, but it is
a big problem when companies have balances that are more outstanding than those of many countries.

These centrifugal thrusts are shattering every day more the dream of the
big, unique and pacific network.
Internet users are more and more closed in limited bubbles, because
of their nationalities and cultures or the profit plans of the big corps.

Note that - as the book's authors - I don't think that the occidental US-centric
world has the correct/absolute answers for that. In many cases, I cannot share some ideas and
values considered _standard thinking_ overseas. I don't even know
if the tentative regulation policies here in Europe will succeed in creating
a better and respectful network.

Moreover, in many countries the Internet is limited and under the control/monitoring of central authorities, and I'm not
talking only about North Korea, China, Russia, Iran, or other nations with some known issues
in accessing the network. As we all discovered in the immediate past, even the so-called free
democracies [show their fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) from time to time. 

Anyway, as tech-savvy individuals, we have the right and duty to escape as much as possible
from the mainstream short-field vision of the network, by diversifying and
avoiding the walled gardens, as well as 
the [_unique thought_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pens%C3%A9e_unique) for the 
[evolution of the society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man).

It is a matter of freedom and equality for all of us, even if it is wishful thinking.
And above all, even if many people out there do not care and are willing to give up
their privacy and freedom, too.

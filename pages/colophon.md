## How I did it

As explained [in my first
post](https://lovergine.com/rebuild-process-running.html), at a certain point in
time, I decided that having a personal blog website was the way to go to avoid
the big trap of fluid social networks governed by some BigCos and exposed to
changes in their policies and decisions. For the same reason, I moved to
Mastodon to do micro-blogging. This site is maintained as a jamstack system
based on Debian GNU/Linux and Apache to serve a bunch of static HTML pages with
just a small set of CSS style sheets. Posts are written as Markdown documents
under Vim or Emacs and managed for building with Haunt.

So, a minimal list of the tools I use to build this site is the following:

 - [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/)
 - [Apache](https://www.apache.org)
 - [Haunt](https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html) and [GNU Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/)
 - [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
 - [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
 - [Gimp](httpa://www.gimp.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (occasionally for images)
 - [Let's Encrypt Certificate Authority](https://letsencrypt.org/)

The whole thing is nicely hosted on a Scaleway VPS in EU. 
Posts are written rigorously by hand, but for AI-based grammar revisions.

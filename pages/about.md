title: About me
---

## Hi.

I'm universally known as *Frankie*, a long-time Debian Developer and FLOSS
activist. I found my way into the free/open-source world in the mid-90s, thanks
to my job as a researcher and the experiences after my degree in Computer Science.
Currently, I'm mainly interested in geospatial technologies and methodologies
in Earth observation. Still, like many early geeks, I have extensive experience in system
administration and general computing, HPC, and other fields of ICT. My expertise
includes C/C++, Tcl, Perl, Python, R, and many *nix tools and tiny languages.

Since the beginning of this millennium, as a [Debian Developer](https://www.debian.org/devel/),
I'm involved in the maintainership of multiple software I'm interested in.

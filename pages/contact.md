title: Contact information
---

I receive many messages, and you usually need to convince me that you are not a
spammer and that what you are writing requires my attention. I prefer that you
use ordinary ticketing systems and mailing lists for projects in which I'm
involved as a developer. That said, I'm quite responsive during the day (CET
timezone).

## Email

This is my preferred contact method. You can use any of the following 
addresses, communicating both in english or italian:

 * `francesco @ lovergine.com`
 * `frankie @ debian.org`
 * `frankie @ fsfe.org`
 * `frankie @ linux.com`
 * `fpl @ cpan.org`

and eventually pass multiple spam filters.

## IRC networks

I'm enough aged to still use `IRC` networks and you can contact me on:

 * [OFTC](https://www.oftc.net/) (as `frankie` on multiple Debian official channels)
 * [LiberaChat ](https://libera.chat/) (as `frankie` on `#linux-it` and other channels) 

## Discord

My user name is:

 * `fpl5466`

## Telegram

My user name is:

 * `@frankie-is-a-geek`

If you're into social media, you can even follow me on
[Mastodon](https://floss.social/@gisgeek).

- This is the [haunt](https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html)-based version of my personal blog site.
- This is a jamstack web site based on [GNU Guile language](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/), a Scheme (Lisp variant) dialect.
- Contents are maintained with `vim`, `git `and `rsync`.
- Scripts are based on those written with love by [Dave Thompson](https://github.com/https://git.dthompson.us/haunt.git), [Stephen Lloyd](https://gitlab.com/zosho/somenotes-source) and [Janneke Nieuwenhuizen](https://gitlab.com/janneke/joyofsource.com).
